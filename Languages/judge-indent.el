;;; Commentary:

;; The `judge-indent-mode' judges, soon after finding file,
;; indent and tab widths from following 8 (strictly 7) patterns.
;; Then, you can add your code without breaking existing indent style.
;;
;;       \  indent
;;        \  2 4 8
;;     tab \------
;;       4 | o c -
;;       8 | o o c <- It can not distinguish when indent width equals to tab width.
;;     nil | o o o

;;; Usage:

;; Add following 3 lines into your emacs config file.
;;     (require 'judge-indent)
;;     (global-judge-indent-mode t)
;;     (setq judge-indent-major-modes '(c-mode python-mode sh-mode))

;;; Customization:

;; Set default indent width (2, 4 or 8).
;; Default: default value of `c-basic-offset' or 4.
;;     (setq judge-indent-default-indent-width 2)
;;
;; Set default tab width (4 or 8).
;; Default: default value of `tab-width' or 8.
;;     (setq judge-indent-default-tab-width 4)
;;
;; Set flag of preferring tab or not when indent is not so deep.
;; Default: default value of `indent-tabs-mode' or nil.
;;     (setq judge-indent-prefer-tabs-mode t)
;;
;; Set relative tolerance [%] for judging indent and tab widths.
;; Default: 5 %.
;;     (setq judge-indent-relative-tolerance 3)
;;
;; Set search limit for large size files.
;; Default: 30000 chars (equal to ca. 1000 lines).
;;     (setq judge-indent-search-limit 60000)
