;; Any external viewer and flagging application that uses the same

  "Parse the entry at point for shortcuts and expand them.
These shortcuts are meant for fast and easy typing on the limited
keyboards of a mobile device.  Below we show a list of the shortcuts
currently implemented.

The entry is expected to contain an inactive time stamp indicating when
the entry was created.  When setting dates and
times (for example for deadlines), the time strings are interpreted
relative to that creation date.
Abbreviations are expected to take up entire lines, jst because it is so
easy to type RET on a mobile device.  Abbreviations start with one or two
letters, followed immediately by a dot and then additional information.
Generally the entire shortcut line is removed after action have been taken.
Time stamps will be constructed using `org-read-date'.  So for example a
line \"dd. 2tue\" will set a deadline on the second Tuesday after the
creation date.

Here are the shortcuts currently implemented:

dd. string             set deadline
ss. string             set scheduling
tt. string             set time tamp, here.
ti. string             set inactive time

tg. tag1 tag2 tag3     set all these tags, change case where necessary
td. kwd                set this todo keyword, change case where necessary

FIXME: Hmmm, not sure if we can make his work against the
auto-correction feature.  Needs a bit more thinking.  So this function
is currently a noop.")
