;;
;; Introduction
;; ------------
;;
;; This package facilitates when you need to switch from a .cpp file,
;; for example, to a corresponding .hpp file.  That is, you visit a
;; .cpp file, type M-x switch-cc-to-h RET, and the corresponding .hpp
;; file is visited automagically.
;;
;; It also helps when you have three (or more) file extensions to
;; switch, for example, you could have .cpp, .hpp and .inc extensions.
;; So, you could switch from a .cpp file to a .hpp file, from .hpp to
;; .inc, and from .inc to .cpp again.
;;
;; For good performance, be sure to byte-compile switch-file.el, e.g.
;;
;;    M-x byte-compile-file <give the path to switch-file.el when prompted>
;;
;; This will generate switch-file.elc, which will be loaded instead of
;; switch-file.el.
;;
;; switch-file was tested with GNU Emacs 21, 22 and 23.
;;
;; I don't know if it is compatible with XEmacs.
;;
;;
;; Usage
;; -----
;;
;; To use switch-file, insert in your ~/.emacs:
;;
;;    (require 'switch-file)
;;    (setq switch-path (list <PATH-LIST>))
;;
;; And, for example, to switch from a current .cc file to a .hh
;; corresponding file (or vice-versa) type:
;;
;;    M-x switch-cc-to-h RET
;;
;; As a suggestion for key bindings:
;;
;;    (global-set-key [f3] 'switch-cc-to-h)
;;
;;
;; Options
;; -------
;;
;; Below it's shown a brief description of switch-file options,
;; please, see the options declaration in the code for a long
;; documentation.
;;
;; `switch-path'                Specify a path list for locating files
;;                              to switch.
;;
;; `switch-major-mode-alist'    Specify a major mode alist.
;;
;; To set the above options you may:
;;
;; a) insert code in your ~/.emacs, like:
;;
;;	 (setq switch-path '("some-dir/" "other-dir/"))
;;
;;    This method preserves your default settings when you enter a new
;;    Emacs session.
;;
;; b) or use `set-variable' in your Emacs session, like:
;;
;;	 M-x set-variable RET switch-path RET
;;	 '("some-dir/" "other-dir/") RET
;;
;;    This method preserves your settings only during the current
;;    Emacs session.
;;
;; c) or use customization, for example:
;;	 click on menu-bar *Help* option,
;;	 then click on *Customize*,
;;	 then click on *Browse Customization Groups*,
;;	 expand *Convenience* group,
;;	 and then customize switch-file options.
;;    This way, you may choose if the settings are kept or not when
;;    you leave out the current Emacs session.
;;
;; d) or see the option value:
;;
;;	 C-h v switch-path RET
;;
;;    and click the *customize* hypertext button.
;;    This way, you may choose if the settings are kept or not when
;;    you leave out the current Emacs session.
