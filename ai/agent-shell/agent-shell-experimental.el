;; session/push: Server-initiated prompt push.  The server sends
;; a request to the client, followed by session/update notifications,
;; concluded by an session_push_end notification.  The client
;; then responds to the original request.

manually translates on the way out.

Example:

becomes:

  \\='((:method . \"session/push\")
