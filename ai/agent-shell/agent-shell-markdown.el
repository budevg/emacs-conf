;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Convert a Markdown string into propertized text:
;;
;;   (agent-shell-markdown-convert "hello **world**")
;;
;; Or rewrite the current buffer in place:
;;
;;   (agent-shell-markdown-replace-markup)
;;
;; Both remove the markup characters and leave behind face text
;; properties.  Supported markup:
;;
;;   bold        `**X**' / `__X__'        face `agent-shell-markdown-bold'
;;   italic      `*X*'   / `_X_'          face `agent-shell-markdown-italic'
;;   strike      `~~X~~'                  face `agent-shell-markdown-strikethrough'
;;   header      `# X' .. `###### X'      face `agent-shell-markdown-header-1' .. `-6'
;;   inline code `` `X` ``                face `agent-shell-markdown-inline-code'
;;   link        `[title](url)'           face `agent-shell-markdown-link', keymap opens URL
;;   image       `![alt](url)'            `display' property carries image
;;   image path  bare image path on a line  same as `![alt](url)' (no markup)
;;   divider     `---' / `***' / `___'    rendered as an underlined rule line
;;   fenced code ```LANG\nX\n```          body syntax-highlighted via LANG mode
;;   tables      `| A | B |' grid rows    rendered with aligned columns,
;;                                         unicode borders, header/zebra rows
;;                                         and wrap-to-window-width support
;;
;; All agent-shell-markdown-* faces inherit from the conventional faces
;; (`bold', `italic', `org-level-N', etc.) so default rendering is
;; unchanged, while still letting users customize markdown output
;; without disturbing the source faces elsewhere.
;;
;; Open / streaming fenced blocks (no closing fence yet) are
;; left alone so their contents stay protected as the buffer
;; grows.

  "Convert MARKDOWN string into propertized text.

Bold, italic, strikethrough, headers, and inline code are
rendered as text properties on the inner text; the markup
characters are removed.  See `agent-shell-markdown-replace-markup' for
the in-buffer equivalent.

For example:

  (agent-shell-markdown-convert \"_my_ **text**\")
  => #(\"my text\" 0 2 (face italic) 3 7 (face bold))"
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert markdown)

  "Replace Markdown markup in current buffer with propertized text.

Rewrites the buffer in place: markup characters are removed and
the remaining text carries face properties.  Faces compose, so a
span nested inside another type ends up with all applicable
faces.

Markup inside fenced code blocks and inline code spans is left
alone.  Streaming-friendly: an unclosed fence protects the rest
of the buffer, an unclosed inline backtick protects the rest of
its line, and incomplete bold/italic/strike spans are skipped
until their closing delimiter arrives.

Italic, bold, and strike passes loop until a full round makes no
changes, so adjacent delimiters peel one layer per round
(e.g. `**_X_**' resolves in two rounds).  Headers, inline code,
links, images, bare image-path lines, dividers, source-block
styling, and table styling run once after the loop.

The buffer is narrowed to the streaming watermark for the
duration of the passes — content before the watermark is already
rendered and stable, so every regex / property scan starts there
instead of `point-min'.  The watermark is read off the
`agent-shell-markdown-watermark' text property on the first
character and re-stamped at the end of the call.  Pass FORCE
non-nil to drop the watermark and re-render the whole buffer
(useful after mid-buffer edits, or for tests).

RENDER-IMAGES, when non-nil (the default), replaces `![alt](url)'
markup with displayed images where the URL resolves to an image
file; nil leaves the markup as-is.  HIGHLIGHT-BLOCKS, when non-nil
(the default), runs the fenced-block body through the language's
major-mode font-lock to colour keywords / strings / etc.; nil
strips the fences and inserts the action label but leaves the
body un-fontified."

Each element is an alist with keys :start, :end (the region to

string — that should be rendered into that region).

Two flavours of region are collected:

  - Pure ASCII tables: 2 or more consecutive `|...|' lines, not
    in a frozen region.  A `|---|...' separator row is optional
    — when present it splits header from data; when absent all
    rows are rendered as data.

  - Rendered table + extension: a previously-rendered table
    carries its original source on each char via the
    `agent-shell-markdown-table-source' property.  Chars immediately
    after the rendered region are folded back in: characters up
    to the next `\\n' are continuation of the rendered table's
    last source row (i.e. a chunk boundary that split a row mid-
    cell), and any complete `|...|' lines that follow extend the
    table with new rows.  The combined source is stashed and the
    region is re-rendered.

A rendered table with no extension is skipped — re-rendering
unchanged source is a no-op."

  "Return TEXT broken into (SUBSTRING FACES) runs.

Each element is a contiguous run of characters with the same
`face' property: SUBSTRING is the run text, FACES is a list of
face symbols (a single symbol is wrapped, an unfaced run gets an
empty list).  Runs are returned in left-to-right order and cover
TEXT in full.

For example:

  (agent-shell-markdown--deconstruct
   (agent-shell-markdown-convert \"_my_ **text**\"))
  => ((\"my\" (italic)) (\" \" nil) (\"text\" (bold)))"
